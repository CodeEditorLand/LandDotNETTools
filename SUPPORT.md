## How to file issues and get help

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please
search the
[existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues) before
filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, please consider reporting
directly from VS Code 'Report Issue' (from Help menu) as it provides additional
helpful information for the team.
